Alright, so what is this???

Back in April 2019, I published this library to PyPI, no source included, just a tarball and wheel.

I thought it would be useful to use across my projects, but after publishing I couldn't really find any uses for it, other than in area4's author info functionality.
So, I just never updated it.

A number of people thought that it was only on PyPI to be a dependency that silently included malware,
because *it was so small that I didn't see any purpose in publishing the source code*.

I can assure you, it is not malware. You can download the artifacts for yourself and check.

Here is the source for you. Its now under the Unlicense, so go crazy with it.

area4 no longer depends on this library for the reasons outlined above. As a matter-of-fact, nobody should.
Just let this essentially useless library die in peace, please.

Thanks,
Reece
